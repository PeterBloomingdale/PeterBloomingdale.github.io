Pharmacometrician. Passionate about improving science.

Current primary research interests (limiting myself to three) are decentralized science, generative algorithms, and science communication.

Long term goal is to develop a non-profit research organization focused on technology, health, and the environment.

Personal website is currently under development, but this blog is a nice quick placeholder!
