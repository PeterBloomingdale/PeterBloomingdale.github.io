        "ChatGPT, and other AI chatbots, have real potential to improve education, productivity, and creativity by supplementing current avenues of infomation retrieval (e.g., search engines). ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, but since GPT-4 is planned to drop in spring 2023 we could see significant improvements in ChatGPT in the near future.\n",
        "\n",
        "The disruptive nature of this technology will permeate throughout all industries, and entities/individuals that do not adequetly utilize these resources will face competitive disadvantages. The industries most impacted by this technology, in my opinion, is content creation, software development, and education. Content creation is the obvious example. Coding solutions may be obtained faster by ChatGPT than going with the Google or Stack Overflow route. Using AI chatboxes as a way to learn could become more effective than traditional classroom learning. However, one must be careful about the potential misinformation generated by these algorithms. \n",
